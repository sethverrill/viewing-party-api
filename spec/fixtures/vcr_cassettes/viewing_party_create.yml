        Luke you wild beautiful thing!\r\n\r\nLuke (Paul Newman) lands himself in
        a Deep South prison farm for drunkenly cutting the heads off of parking meters.
        Once at the farm Luke refuses to be ground down by the system and its grinning
        warden (a brilliant Strother Martin). As things role by Luke becomes something
        of a hero to his fellow inmates and this is not lost on the authority in charge
        of the farm. Things are sure to come to a head as Luke rebels to the point
        of no return...\r\n\r\nDivision of Corrections. Road Prison 36.\r\n\r\nThe
        close examination of Cool Hand Luke over the years has rightly thrown up the
        fact that it''s a Christ allegory. Which is just fine given that Stuart Rosenberg''s
        film is one of the finest films that the 60s had to offer. It also boasts,
        arguably of course, the Paul Newman signature role (yes even better than The
        Hustler). As the title suggests, Cool Hand Luke, both the film and character,
        there is a great deal of cool here, in fact for a great deal of the first
        half of movie it''s laced with comic touches as we warm easily to the \"rebel
        against the system\" machismo and charm that Newman provides as Lukas Jackson.
        Yet the film then shifts considerably at the mid-point to give us something
        far more potent and dramatic to alter any preconceptions the audience had
        of this just being a movie about a macho loner earning our sympathy.\r\n\r\nCalling
        it your job don''t make it right Boss.\r\n\r\nMuch in the film has been firmly
        ensconced in the memorable moments department, 50 eggs, tar that road quickly,
        the \"Kick a Buck\" poker game, \"still shaking boss\", a mountain of rice
        to be eaten, sneezing bloodhounds, the boxing match and one of the greatest
        and most iconic of tag-lines ever, \"what we got here is a failure to communicate\",
        all forming part of a truly great whole. However, revisiting the picture often
        brings the realisation that so much more is on offer than at first thought.
        Luke is a real war hero (this has been missed by both pro and amateur critics)
        whose crime is pretty tame for the sentence he finds himself faced with. The
        Dragline (George Kennedy kicking up a storm of acting quality) and Luke friendship
        that builds with grace and thunder, sexual frustration of the incarcerated
        male and a mother and son arc that attacks the soul and lets Newman show many
        of his acting peers just how grief should be acted out on screen...\r\n\r\n\"Well,
        I don''t care if it rains or freezes, Long as I have my plastic Jesus, Riding
        on the dashboard of my car. Through all trials and tribulations, We will travel
        every nation, With my plastic Jesus I''ll go far\"\r\n\r\nWith Newman, Kennedy
        and Martin holding court with every scene they are in, it would be easy at
        first glance to ignore the supporting roles, but Rosenberg ensures that supporting
        players make telling marks. It''s a roll call of sweaty and twitchy character
        actors that features the likes of Anthony Zerbe, Joe Don Baker, Clifton James,
        Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers and J.D.
        Cannon. Filmed in Technicolor and Panavision, Rosenberg and cinematographer
        Conrad Hall do an amazing job of making Stockton, California feel like the
        actual Deep South. Film unfolds to the backdrop of a sun drenched land inhabited
        by life''s unfortunates and the supposed upstanding face of American officialdom...\r\n\r\nIconography
        and martyrdom unbound, Cool Hand Luke is a slow-burn classic of deep thematic
        worth. 10/10","created_at":"2019-01-19 20:28:24 UTC","id":"5c4388689251412bf1dc6e74","updated_at":"2024-05-16

        rebellion at a time when everything deserved to be questioned.**\r\n\r\nThe
        late sixties marked the rise of a culture of rebellion and challenge to the
        established order. Young people, university students, minorities, suddenly
        society goes into upheaval and begins to question and make demands. In a very
        specific way, I think this film fits very well into this movement, giving
        us the story of a man who made mistakes and paid – that''s for sure – and
        who, between hits and misses, wanted to find his own space in the world and
        live life on his terms.\r\n\r\nLuke Jackson is truly a non-conformist man
        and the face of a generation of people increasingly dissatisfied with the
        society in which they live. The film makes clear that he had everything in
        his hands to have other destiny, a stable and comfortable life, but that his
        own actions ruined everything. Why? Because that wasn''t enough, and he wanted
        something different. Maybe he didn''t know exactly what he wanted, but he
        knew exactly what he didn''t want: to feel subjugated. This expresses what
        American society, particularly young people, had been feeling: no more meaningless
        rules, absolute dogmas, ostracism and sacred cows. In that prison where even
        to urinate or drink water they have to ask permission, Luke questioned all.\r\n\r\nA
        good story, very well written and with magnificent dialogues, is accompanied
        by a good work of cinematography, sets and costumes, and an effective direction
        guaranteed by Stuart Rosenberg. It is in the editing work that I felt the
        biggest mistakes were made, giving the film an uneven rhythm, as the film
        was composed of a collage of episodes from Luke''s time in that work camp.
        That is, it lacks the idea and feeling of unity and fluidity, with several
        situations similar to each other and a certain absence of dramatic tension,
        more palpable in the final half.\r\n\r\nPaul Newman provides a strong and
        charismatic lead and was a safe bet to play the rebel hero. Fortunately for
        us, the film has the support of several other great actors in supporting roles,
        preventing it from being a one-man effort. George Kennedy, who won the Oscar
        for Best Supporting Actor thanks to this film, stands out from the crowd thanks
        to a careful performance, the best of this actor''s career. Worthy of mention
        are also the efforts of J. D. Cannon, Jo Van Fleet, Lou Antonio and Strother
        Martin.","created_at":"2024-03-16 12:49:41 UTC","id":"65f59565aede590163beae8a","updated_at":"2024-03-16
