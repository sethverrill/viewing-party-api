        a house in Oxford lived a remarkable man called J.R.R. Tolkien who told stories
        that thrilled the world. To this very day readers and film audiences are enjoying
        his magnificent epics “THE LORD OF THE RINGS” and “The Hobbit” – adapted to
        the big screen by producer, Peter Jackson. Although everybody has heard of
        Tolkien’s writing, very few people could tell you much about the man responsible
        for creating the best loved magical creatures that have become household names.
        This program will give you a real insight into the man behind the legends
        of “THE LORD OF THE RINGS,” and the people and places that shaped his unique
        literary genius. From the rolling English countryside to the sooty streets
        of Industrial Birmingham, the dreaming spires of Oxford to the World War I
        trenches of the blood soaked Somme; this is the story of the quintessential
        English College Professor who made epic mythology and legend accessible to

        of the trilogy of The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, in an attempt to
        understand the work''s phenomenal success and influence. The program looks
        for answers in the author''s sources of inspiration, from the folk legends
        of Norway to the field of linguistics of which Tolkien was a lifelong student.
        It finds that the deep chord the story strikes owes its resonance to the author''s
        use of archetypal imagery and language. Many examples of these recurrent themes
        and images are given, with readings from the work and other literature. Interviews
        with the book''s illustrators, the brothers Hildebrandt, speak to the power
        of the imagery in the classic story. Scholars, Tolkien''s children, and the
        author himself provide insight into the mythic themes and the spell they have
        cast over the vast readership of The Lord of the Rings.","popularity":2.157,"poster_path":"/7fzIaIcpj4f0O3IHE65qGqlNcuL.jpg","release_date":"2001-12-04","title":"Master
